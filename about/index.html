				<h2>Nadim</h2>
				<p>Hi, I’m Nadim and I am currently studying Computer Science in my first year at UCL. Read on if you want to find out why I’ve chosen to write this series of tutorials.</p>
				<p>I was given many electronic components including an Arduino and decided to explore what could be done with them. I started off with doing a simple LED circuit and was very proud of it at the time - it s always a joy when your first circuit or program
					works as intended! I then moved on to more complex circuits but couldn’t come around building them as the material online was not very detailed. After my first term, I had programmed a sit-up counter and had a much better understanding of the Arduino
					software. A second project I worked on was building a control system for a model bioreactor. This helped me improve my understanding of circuits. So I decided I wanted to combine my knowledge and produce the tutorial that would’ve helped me avoid
					the initial struggle. </p>

				<h2>David</h2>
				<p>I'm David and I am currently a first year computer science student at UCL. I worked on these tutorials to help beginner programmers to get into the world of Arduino and Processing.</p>
				<p>When I just began exploring the world of programming I wanted to program robots. There was however no simple platform to do so. I discovered Arduino a few years ago and have built multiple projects with it since. Arduino and Processing are both great
					and simple platforms, perfect to start learning programming. So I tried to create tutorials which would have helped me then I just started.</p>
